[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/oprand/opr)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/oprand/opr)

The `opr` CLI tool from [oprand.com](https://oprand.com/) offers access to public and private threat data.

* **Public Data:**
  * [ASN](#asn)
* **Private Data:**
  * [Phishing threat and domain impersonation scan results](#private-threat-data)

## Installation

```
go install github.com/oprand/opr/cmd/opr@latest
```

The `opr` binary will be installed in the directory named by the `$GOBIN` environment
variable, which defaults to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` if the `GOPATH`
environment variable is not set.

If you don't have `go` installed, download from our [release page](https://github.com/oprand/opr/releases).

## Public Data

[Oprand](https://oprand.com/) provides a free and public access to some of its in-house aggregated data.

### ASN

* ASN lookup: `opr asn AS3`
* ASN lookup by IP: `opr asn 1.1.1.1`
* ASN lookup by domain: `opr asn example.com`
* ASN lookup by email domain: `opr asn @orange.com`
* Your IP's ASN: `opr asn me`

```bash
# Batch queries possible:
opr asn AS5,8.8.8.8,@google.com

# Return results in JSON:
opr asn --json example.com

## Return all IPs under an ASN:
opr asn --ip AS5

## Return all CIDR under an ASN:
opr asn --cidr AS5

## Read from stdin:
echo tesla.com | opr asn
```

Golang library usage also possible:
```golang
import "github.com/oprand/opr/client"

opr := client.New(client.OprClientParams{})

asnResponse, err := opr.GetAsn("AS3", "1.1.1.1")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

for _, asn := range asnResponse {
    fmt.Printf("input:%s\n", asn.Input)
    fmt.Printf("error:%s\n", asn.Error)
    fmt.Printf("data:%v\n", asn.Output)
}
```

For more information and usage see our [ASN data documentation](https://oprand.com/asn/).


## Private Threat Data

[Oprand](https://oprand.com/) provides phishing threat and domain impersonation detection services.
We publish a public [Phishing Threat Report](https://oprand.com/report).

Access to the data below requires an Oprand account.

- No analytics or bug report system is included - please [report manually](https://github.com/oprand/opr/issues)

### How To Use Our GPG Public Key

Key signatures allow you verify the files were indeed provided by us. 

1. Download our release signing public key [here](https://oprand.com/.well-known/release-key.pub)
2. Import it with `gpg --import oprand.pub.gpg`
3. Verify it was imported successfully with `gpg --list-keys`

#### Verify Our Releases Signature

After having imported our key, download `opr.checksum.sha256.txt` and its signature `opr-checksums.sha256.txt.sig`, then run:

```bash
gpg --verify --default-key=B2165DEA opr-checksums.sha256.txt.sig opr-checksums.sha256.txt
```

A `gpg: Good signature` message should be displayed.

### How To Verify Our Releases Checksum

Checksums allow you to verify the integrity of the file you downloaded. Ensuring the file hasn't been modified in transit between Github and your system.

Download the `opr.checksum.sha256.txt` file associated with the release. Then from the same folder as your binary's `.zip` file, run:

```bash
# The `--ignore-missing` flag ensures it won't check missing files. 
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing opr.checksum.sha256.txt
```

You should see `OK` on the same line as your binary's `.zip` file.
